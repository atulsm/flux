 * 1. Observe how concurrency works - there is no method that depends on output of another method
 * 2. Observe how the methods EmailMarketingWorkflow.sendEmails and EmailDispatcher.sendEmail are annotated with @Workflow and @Task respectively
 * 3. Observe how we are using javax.inject annotations for Dependency Injection
